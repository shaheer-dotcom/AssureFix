I've removed the overly bright glass effect and replaced it with a **clean, subtle, professional design** that maintains the blue and white color scheme without the excessive transparency and blur.

#### 2. **Cards** - Solid & Clean
- **Before**: Transparent with heavy blur effect (too bright)
- **After**: Solid white cards with subtle shadows - much easier to read

#### 3. **Text Fields** - Clear & Readable
- **Before**: Transparent with blur (hard to see)
- **After**: Solid white background with clear borders - easy to read and use

#### 4. **Buttons** - Solid & Professional
- **Before**: Transparent overlay with blur and heavy shadows
- **After**: Solid blue buttons with normal elevation - clear and clickable

#### 5. **App Bar** - Clean Blue
- **Before**: Gradient with blur and transparency
- **After**: Solid blue (#1E88E5) - professional and clear

#### 6. **Containers** - Simple & Clean
- **Before**: Transparent with blur
